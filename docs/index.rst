Why It's Important to Activate Cable One
The last step is activation, which connects your physical connection to the service plan you bought. If you don't finish activation, your modem won't connect to the network, your internet may not work, and other services like TV or phone may not work either. Activation also links your equipment to your account and checks that your address is correctly linked to the service region.

Before you start activation, you need to know

Before you start the activation procedure, get the following:

Your account number for Cable One (Sparklight), which you can usually find in your welcome email or service confirmation.

Your phone number and billing address are on file.

The make, model, and MAC address of your modem or gateway, which is usually on a label on the device.

A working internet connection (mobile data is fine for this step).

For setup, you need a laptop or smartphone that works with it.

If you bought or rented a modem from Cable One, it should already be set up to work. Make sure that Cable One approves your modem for service if you are using your own.

How to Turn on Cable One Internet Service

Step 1: Hook up your modem

Connect the coaxial cable to the modem and the wall outlet.

Plug the power wire into an outlet that works.

The lights on the modem will blink while it starts up and then stay steady.

Step 2: Connect the modem to a device

Connect your computer or laptop to the modem with an Ethernet connection.
OR

To connect to the modem's default Wi-Fi network, look for the SSID and password on the modem.

Step 3: Open a web browser

Open a web browser and see whether you can get to any site.

You will be taken to the Cable One activation portal automatically.
If you don't get redirected, go to the default activation page that came with your welcome package.

Step 4: Fill up the information for your account

Follow the instructions on the page to input your address, phone number, and account number.

If asked, give the MAC address of your modem.

Wait for the system to check your details and finish the activation.

Step 5: Turn the modem back on

After the activation is successful, the system may ask you to restart your modem. Take it out of the wall for 30 seconds and then plug it back in. Your changed settings will let the modem rejoin to the network.

Turning on extra services (TV or phone)

For cable TV
If you're also turning on cable TV, ensure sure your set-top box is connected with coaxial and turned on. Most boxes will turn on by themselves when they are connected. If not, you might have to call customer service to refresh it by hand.

For the home phone
Plug your phone line into the rear of the modem or gateway. If the service doesn't start up on its own once you turn on the modem, check your account dashboard or get in touch with support.

Using the app on your phone to activate
Cable One has a mobile app called Sparklight. You can use the app to do the following after connecting your modem:
